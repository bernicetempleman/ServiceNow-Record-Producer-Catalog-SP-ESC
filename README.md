# ServiceNow-Record-Producer-Catalog-SP-ESC

"ESS users typically log incidents using a record producer in the service catalog. 
A template can be used to create an incident record producer. The template automatically populates fields in the incident form.
For example, an incident record producer can be created to request account access to a network server. The user who submits the incident enters variable values, such as the server name, level of access needed, and due date. The incident template assigned to the record producer populates the incident Category, Subcategory, and Assignment Group. These fields and values applied from the template do not appear in the record producer form."
